# AmigaTools

A collection of small command-line tools for AmigaOS.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| [dupfind](dupfind/) | Recursively scan a directory for duplicate files, with fast header-based, hash-confirmed checksum, or exact full-byte comparison modes. |

Each tool lives in its own subdirectory with its own README covering
usage, how it works, and how to build it.

## Building

Tools here are written in [Amiga E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(programming_language))
and compiled with the E-VO compiler:

```
evo <toolname>.e
```

This produces a native AmigaOS loadseg()able executable.
